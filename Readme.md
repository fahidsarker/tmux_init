# tmux_init

> A modern, Go-powered alternative to [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) for managing **complex `tmux` workflows** with ease.

**`tmux_init`** is a simple, cross-platform CLI tool built in **Go** that helps you define and launch structured `tmux` sessions using YAML config files.
